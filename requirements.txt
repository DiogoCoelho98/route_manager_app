Project Overview
→ Objective: Create a web app that allows users to plan, save, and share routes.
→ Backend: Python with Flask.
→ Frontend: HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript (Vanilla + Leaflet.js).
→ Database: SQLite.


Core Features
→ User Authentication
    Description: Allow users to create accounts and log in.
    Implementation: Flask-Login for session management.

→ Route Creation
    Description: Users can create routes by drawing on a map or entering addresses.
    Implementation: Leaflet.js for map, geocoding with Nominatim, realistic routing with OpenRouteService.

→ Route Storage
    Description: Store only key points (start, waypoints, end) for each route.
    Implementation: Save minimal coordinate set in SQLite, and generate full geometry on demand.

→ Static Map Image
    Description: Show a static map image with start, end, and waypoint markers for each route.
    Implementation: Generate image with StaticMap.

→ Route Details
    Description: Display route details (distance, elevation gain/loss, min/max/avg elevation, country).
    Implementation: Calculate metrics using OpenRouteService (country detected via reverse geocoding).

→ Community Features
    Description: Users can comment on routes.
    Implementation: Comments section under each route.

→ Responsive UI & UX
    Description: Mobile-friendly design, video backgrounds, clear marker legend, modern footer.
    Implementation: Tailwind CSS for styling, custom JS for interactivity.



Future Plans / Improvements
→ Map Search
    Add a map input to allow users to search for locations directly on the map.

→ Interactive route editing: allow users to drag points to tweak routes.
    Real-time updates: dynamically update route and metrics as users edit.

→ Route Ratings
    Implement a feature for users to rate routes.

→ Elevation Profile Visualization
    Display an elevation profile graph (ChartJS) on the route details view.

→ Route Sharing & Export
    Generate shareable links and export routes as GPX/KML files.

→ Map Enhancements
    Add traffic overlays, points of interest, or weather layers.
